# Title : Alzheimer's Data Analysis with Apache Spark and Hadoop
## Platform : 
  Python, Github, PySpark, SparkSQL,
  Spark-ML, Hadoop, Airflow and Tableau
## Duration : 
  1 Month
## Description : 
  This project focuses on scalable data processing and predictive analytics for Alzheimer's disease risk assessment
  using Apache Spark and Hadoop. The dataset is stored in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) to ensure
  efficient data management. Key responsibilities include performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and
  developing Machine Learning (ML) models in Apache Spark to identify critical risk factors. Apache Airflow is
  utilized for workflow orchestration, automating data pipelines and model execution. The project concludes with an
  interactive Tableau dashboard, providing data-driven insights to support early diagnosis and risk assessment of
  Alzheimer's disease.
